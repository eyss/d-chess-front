# d-chess frontend

Frontend implementation for the d-chess holochain app.

## Running

Firstly, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

To run two players with which to play against each other, run two terminals:

1. Terminal 1, agent alice
```
npm start
```

2. Terminal 2, agent bob
```
npm run start:bob
```

Now the frontends are ready to be connected to the backend at https://github.com/eyss/d-chess-back.
